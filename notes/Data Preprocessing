1. Some stock values have negative values for some reason in PRC and OPENPRC columns - If you want to convert all to
positive using abs run the forcePositives function. (Have not fully tested whether these instances are intentional)

2. Most stocks have some NaN values in PRC and OPENPRC columns (including AAPL). A fix using now is to
    a. fill missing OPENPRC with their previous row's PRC
    b. fill missing PRC with current rows OPENPRC, if that fails then do previous row's PRC - Executes concurrently with a
    c. Chop off all beginning rows with NaNs until first row with no NaNs

    d. If there are multiple rows in a row with NaN values, that stock will be excluded if exclude_nan = True

3. To see what affects are currently applied on your dataset check the majorOpLog in tests.
This log will be empty upon initialization and will keep track of the major operations done on the dataset.
Currently, there are 2 major operations SHOWN ABOVE
