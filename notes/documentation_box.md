# Box Naive Algorithm Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the `BollingerNaive` class and the associated `BollingerBands` class used for implementing a simple trading algorithm based on Bollinger Bands.


## Modules and Dependencies

- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `os`: To interact with the operating system, mainly for file and directory operations.
- `json`: To work with JSON data.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `math`: Provides access to mathematical functions.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs and charts.
- `concurrent.futures`: For parallel execution of tasks.
- `tqdm`: For displaying progress bars.
- `config`: Contains configuration variables like `DATA_DIR`.

## Class: DarvasTrader

The `DarvasTrader` class inherits from `StockAlgorithmDaily` and implements a naive trading strategy based on Bollinger Bands.

The Naive strategy enters on upper box breaks and exits on lower box breaks
The strategy only goes long

Boxes are calculated as follows
- Find a new 12-month high.
- Find the top of the box, which is the highest high for the next three days (4 days total).
- After finding the top, look for the bottom of the box. It's the lowest low for the next three days (4 days total).
- Once the box is complete, a close above the top of the box signals a buy.
- A close below the bottom of the box is the sell signal. Exit and then go back to step 1.

```



# Boc Calculation

## Overview
This script defines a class `BollingerBands` for calculating and visualizing Bollinger Bands for stock trading data. Bollinger Bands are a volatility indicator that consists of a Simple Moving Average (SMA) and two standard deviation lines, one above and one below the SMA. This script provides functionality for individual stock analysis as well as batch processing of multiple stocks.

You can customize the timeframe / Bperiods

## Class `DarvasBoxCalculator`

### Initialization / Running

```python
calculator = DarvasBoxCalculator(data_directory, name='Default')
calculator.calculate_all_stock_boxes()
```


Notes.
- OHLC is calculated from 5min return data
